# Mouseback

Mouseback is an open source alternative to vercel's preview comments feature. 

## Stack


This is a monorepo with a Next.js dashboard and a Vite project used for the comment tooling. Other tools used are Supabase for DB, Resend for email sending, Shadcn/UI for components and TailwindCSS for styling.

## Setup and configuration

I'll work on setting up an installation and configuration guide for this project in due course.
