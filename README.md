# Mouseback

Mouseback is an open source user feedback widget. It's primary focus is to offer an alternative to platform specific tools like Vercel preview comments or the Netlify Drawer.

## Stack

This is a monorepo built with Turborepo. It contains a Next.js dashboard for managing a "team" mouseback instance, and a Vite project used for the comment tooling.

Other tools used are Supabase for DB, Resend for email sending, Shadcn/UI for components and TailwindCSS for styling.

## Setup and configuration

I'll work on setting up an installation and configuration guide for this project in due course. If anyone would like to help me figure out how to do this properly, please create an issue or email me on dave@davehawkins.co.
